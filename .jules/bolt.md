## 2024-05-23 - Conditional Filtering in React Lists
**Learning:** Large lists filtered in `useMemo` hooks can cause significant performance overhead if the filter logic runs even when the list is hidden.
**Action:** Always check if the consuming component is visible or if the list is needed before executing the filter logic inside `useMemo`. Add an early return if the list is not needed.

## 2024-05-23 - Redundant Client-Side Filtering
**Learning:** Chaining filters (e.g., Parent component filters -> Child component filters again) is a common anti-pattern that doubles iteration costs.
**Action:** When a child component receives an already filtered list, ensure its internal filtering is optimized to skip work (e.g., return the prop directly) when its own local filters are inactive.
