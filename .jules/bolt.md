## 2025-04-04 - Pre-compute Searchable Text in React Components
**Learning:** In React components that render large lists and allow search filtering (like `LeftSidebar`), recalculating `.toLowerCase()` or `.join()` on every item inside the `.filter()` callback during keystrokes causes significant layout jank.
**Action:** Decouple the string transformation from the fast filtering loop by pre-computing a separate array of `searchableItems` wrapped in a `useMemo` hook that maps over the original data. The actual keystroke `filter` can then use these pre-computed string properties, operating near-instantly.

**Learning:** In React components that render large lists and allow search filtering (like Notes, Papers, and Ideas views), recalculating `.toLowerCase()` or executing regular expressions on every item inside the `.filter()` callback during keystrokes causes significant layout jank.
**Action:** Decouple the string transformation from the fast filtering loop by pre-computing a separate array of `searchableItems` wrapped in a `useMemo` hook that maps over the original data. The actual keystroke `filter` can then use these pre-computed string properties, operating near-instantly.

## 2024-04-08 - ISO Date String Comparison Optimization
**Learning:** Instantiating Date objects (e.g. `parseDateInput(due_date)?.getTime()`) inside `Array.prototype.sort()` callbacks is extremely expensive and causes performance bottlenecks, especially with large lists like tasks. ISO-8601 formatted date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) are naturally sortable lexicographically.
**Action:** Always use direct string comparison (`a > b ? 1 : -1`) for ISO date strings inside sort callbacks instead of parsing them into Date objects. Use a high/low string fallback like `"9999-12-31"` for missing dates to maintain `Infinity` placement behavior.
## 2024-04-15 - Prevent layout jank in animation loops by pre-computing Map lookups
**Learning:** Avoid using Array.prototype.find() or creating new Map objects inside high-frequency animation loops (like tick() or requestAnimationFrame), as this causes per-frame memory allocation and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Always pre-compute Map lookups outside the loop to reduce O(N x M) complexity to O(N + M) and eliminate garbage collection spikes during layout/animation calculations.
